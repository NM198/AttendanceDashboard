# AttendanceDashboard
Employee attendance and information Dashboard

This project is aiming at finding an efficient solution of automating the process of logging attendance within a traditional office environment.  A raspberry pi model 3B is used as a hardware platform along with an RC522 RFID reader, used to gather the employeeâ€™s data.  The key aim of this project is to find a way to automate the process of attendance tracking of daily attendance log-in, log-out times of employees. Another notable feature of this project includes a web interface granting access to company information, workflow resources and attendance statistics to all employees from top level management to all other employees as to enable employee management and productivity.  The design of the system is effective, portable and inexpensive making it a good fit for commercial and academic purposes.
